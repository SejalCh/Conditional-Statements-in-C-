# Conditional-Statements-in-C-

##**AIM**:To study different conditional statements in C++

##**THEORY**:

<p>The conditional statements such as if, if else, switch, etc. are used for decision-making purposes in C++ programs.Conditional statements in C++ are programming constructs that allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false.The syntax of conditional statements uses relational operators such as:<br>
1.'<' and '>'- less than/greater than<br>
2.'==' and '!=' - equal to/not equal to<br>
3.'<=' and '>=' - less than equal to/greater than equal to </p>

<p>if, if-else , else conditional statements execute the block of codes based on whether the condition is true or false.Meanwhile the switch condition switches between different cases based on the user input.</p>
